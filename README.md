# Homeboard

An ESP8266 based LED system for use with home climbing walls and training boards, driving a string of LEDS (typically WS2811).

All in one solution with LED control, Wifi access and web GUI to manage problems. No intention to log sends or share problems as this is better handled with dedicated app such as Stokt and Retro Flash. Perhaps integration will be avaiable with these apps via Wifi/BLE in the future. 

Required parts:
* ESP2866 (e.g. Wemos D1 R2 etc)
* LED String (e.g. WS2811)
* 5v power
